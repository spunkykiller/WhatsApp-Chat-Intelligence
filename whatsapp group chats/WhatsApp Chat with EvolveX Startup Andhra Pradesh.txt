Hello! I’m in search of a tech co-founder with strong skills in:

Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning
Full-stack Web Development (MERN Stack)
If you’re entrepreneurial, passionate about technology, and ready to co-build impactful solutions, let’s talk! Preference for Telugu speakers or NIT/IIT grads.

👉 Apply here: https : forms.gle/fhQvmUtdvt6kD9SM6
01/12/2024, 16:00 - +91 93815 51926: Hey !

I’ve seen a lot of posts over last 10 years where people look for tech co-founders but they have a hard time finding one that sticks.

Typically people talk about the backgrounds and ideas before looking for a tech co-founder. 

1. If you’re not able to disclose your idea publicly, you should atleast talk about the sector you’re in.
2. ⁠If you’re not a technical co-founder yourself, you need to talk about what you bring to the table.
3. ⁠If you’re someone who hasn’t yet done customer discovery be sure to put yourself through that process. There’s no point in having a technical co-founder if you don’t know have an idea on product market fit.

Hopefully it helps everyone here ! <This message was edited>

Everyone’s offering “cheap and fast.”
But here’s the truth: *If it’s not built right, you’ll pay twice.* Once to build, and once to fix.

At *Spotmies*, we’ve cracked what most agencies haven’t:
✅ *Speed without shortcuts*
✅ *Price without compromise*
✅ *Execution without excuses*

We’re not freelancers rushing out sloppy code.
We’re a product-grade engineering team building serious Web & Mobile Apps, UI/UX, and Web3 systems—*fast, scalable, and built to last*.

💡 We’ve shipped complex products in weeks that others dragged for 3-4 months.

🔁 Think your project is “too complex”? Challenge us.
🎯 Budget constraints? Let’s build smart, not bloated.
⏱️ Missed deadline? You pay less.

But here’s the kicker 👇
We don’t just deliver *on time*, we deliver *quality*.
Every screen, every feature, every interaction is built with care—because we treat your product like our own.

📢 *Don’t just look for cheap. Look for built right.*

DM if you’re serious. Let’s build something you won’t have to rebuild again.

We’re building a new edtech + hiring platform for startups, and your quick feedback would really help us.

Please reply with your thoughts on the below points👇

1️⃣ What challenges do you face while hiring freshers?
(e.g., job-readiness, skill gaps, filtering candidates, communication, retention)

2️⃣ Do you currently use any HRMS/employee portal for onboarding, policies, payroll, etc.? If yes, what limitations do you see?

3️⃣ If you get a chance to adopt a college classroom and cross-train those students specifically for your tech stack and real project needs —
Would you be interested in this model?

4️⃣ Would you like to build your brand presence among college students through workshops, hackathons, internships, etc.?

5️⃣ If we help you hire the right talent directly from colleges (using project-based & AI-driven evaluation),
Would you consider hiring freshers through us?

6️⃣ What matters most to you while hiring freshers?
(attitude, coding ability, communication, cultural fit, internship experience)

7️⃣ Any other expectations you have from a platform helping startups source & train fresh talent?

Your inputs will help us create something truly valuable for startups 🚀
Thanks in advance! 🙏

25/11/2025, 18:42 - +91 94321 81818: 🌟 About Andhra Pradesh Innovation Society (APIS)

Purpose: APIS is the state government’s flagship initiative to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and startup growth in Andhra Pradesh.

Mentorship Role: The society actively engages mentors like G. Ravi Kumar to guide startups, MSMEs, and student innovators through incubation, compliance, and deployment challenges.

Ecosystem Support: APIS provides incubation centers, coworking spaces, startup challenges, and direct government work orders to encourage innovation.

👤 G. Ravi Kumar’s Profile

Professional Background:

Managing Director at X-Men Manpower Solutions India Pvt Ltd since 2013.

Founder & Director at X-UNIEEQ Utility Products India Pvt Ltd since 2022.

Focus Areas: AI-integrated utility products, MSME empowerment, modular product design, and compliance-driven innovation.

Mentorship Contribution: His role as a mentor at APIS aligns with his vision of bridging MSMEs with government integration and sustainable electronics markets.

🚀 Why His Mentorship Matters

For Startups: Ravi Kumar helps early-stage entrepreneurs avoid common pitfalls (like lack of compliance or weak deployment strategies).

For MSMEs: He advocates for direct government procurement models that cut through bureaucratic hurdles, enabling faster adoption of AI and digital tools.

For Students: His outreach includes training modules, branded kits, and multilingual access, ensuring inclusivity in innovation.

⚠️ Challenges & Opportunities

Challenges:

90% of Indian startups fail within 5 years due to lack of mentorship and compliance awareness.

Navigating government procurement and IP protection remains complex.

Opportunities:

APIS’s direct work order model is pioneering in GovTech, offering startups real contracts instead of just grants.

Mentors like Ravi Kumar are crucial in scaling sustainable electronics and AI-driven MSME solutions.

✅ In summary: G. Ravi Kumar plays a strategic role as a mentor in the Andhra Pradesh Innovation Society, leveraging his expertise in AI, MSME empowerment, and compliance-driven innovation to strengthen the state’s startup ecosystem.

27/11/2025, 22:20 - +91 86889 98314: And who are interested in building apps or joining a hackathon!
I’m joining the Bengaluru AI Hack Day on Dec 13th in Whitefield. It’s a full-day event hosted by Ishan Sharma where we build products using AI tools.
The best part is you don't need to be a hardcore coder it's open to designers founders, and creators too. Plus, the prizes are insane MacBooks, PS5s, etc.
I’m looking for people to connect with or maybe form a team. Let me know if you're interested!! <This message was edited>
