    "content": "*Teaching, Research, Skills: The New Confusion Matrix in Higher Education*\n\nDear Friends,\n\nYesterday, I *had the opportunity to attend the AACSB CEO’s Business Schools Meet in New Delhi*. Ms. Lily Bi, President and CEO of AACSB, *delivered an insightful presentation on the current state of management education and institutional readiness*. In my view, these insights are not limited to management alone; they apply to several other domains as well.\n\n*Employers are shifting dramatically toward skills-first hiring* — a 25% rise globally since 2022 — and *27% of employers have removed degree requirements* (SHRM 2025). The top skill gaps identified across undergraduates, postgraduates, and managers include navigating ambiguity, communication skills, and the ability to apply feedback.\n\nThe most interesting and *insightful data point was about what students value most.* Faculty *teaching* quality is the top contributor (23%). *Curriculum* relevance to current business trends follows closely (21%). *Experiential* learning through projects and internships adds strong value (16%). Student *community and networking* matter significantly (12%). Career services and *employability* support are equally important (12%). International exposure—exchange programs and global faculty—adds moderate value (7%). Access to technology and AI tools influences learning (5%). *Research opportunities contribute modestly* (4%).\n\nAfter understanding these priorities *in the age of AI, as a teacher, I am left with new questions.*\n\nWhen *institutions depend heavily on student fees*, and when we are all living in a consumer-first world, what should be the priorities of a teacher? Undoubtedly, a *teacher should be passionate about teaching.* A teacher should be a *storyteller* who meaningfully engages the classroom. A teacher must possess strong *conceptual understanding* of the subject. They must *demonstrate communication skills, classroom management skills, empathy and patience, a student-centred approach, and creativity*.\n\nIn a *small group conversation, we discussed the role of research*.\n\nThe moot question was: *Should a teacher also be a researcher in the age of AI?* The underlying assumption is that AI’s intelligence is slowly surpassing human intelligence. Industry and research institutions are also simultaneously conducting significant research and developing advanced solutions.\n\nThe teacher’s required skill set is already demanding*. *If the teacher must also become a researcher (on top of competing with AI’s research capabilities and human researchers), when will they have the time to master those core six teaching skills?* A school teacher is never a researcher, but rather a creative engager. Ten years ago, when AI was non-existent, higher education required a teacher-cum-researcher. However, today, do we really need this model, especially when students can independently leverage AI-driven research outputs? Or should the teacher’s role shift towards being a facilitator, motivator, or inspirer with strong application orientation?\n\n*This brings us to the big confusion matrix:*\n·       Many *ranking* frameworks demand *research first*.\n·       *Students* demand *teaching first.*\n·       *Industry* demands *skills* first.\n\n*If institutions don’t solve this puzzle thoughtfully, they may pay a hefty price. Those who solve it will create history. Those who ignore it will remain in history.*\n\nNote: Views are personal.\nRavi Saripalle",

    "content": "*The Hidden Cost of Attention – Are You Also Trapped by the Attention Economy?*\n\nDear Friends\n\nRecently, one of the spiritual personalities *delivered a talk to MBA graduates of IIM Calcutta*. He was discussing the *attention economy* and how it has quietly become a new form of currency.\n\nRevenue in today’s world comes from *training us to pay attention*. The mobiles, ads, designs, and people around us are all working towards this new game. *In this attention economy, our focus is constantly being captured and redirected, leading to intermittent attention*. This is evident in schools, colleges, and workplaces, where people attend to tasks only sporadically, frequently distracted in between. *Such fragmented attention is extremely harmful and can lead to a disintegration of the psyche.*\n\nNowadays, when attending any meeting, training, function, or public gathering, you can often observe this issue. He was also referring to the *book Deep Work*, which emphasizes the tremendous value of focused and concentrated work.\n\nFor example, *why does one song receive 1 million views, while another gets 1 billion?* It’s not because the latter is a thousand times better, but because it captures attention far more effectively. Deep work—sustained, focused concentration—is increasingly rare today, yet it is highly energizing and productive.\n\n*He mentioned a boy who secured second rank in the JEE*. This boy gives full concentration to every single activity. Once, somebody visited his hostel room at 6 AM in the morning, and he was meticulously cleaning every inch of the window corners, too, with intense focus and care. A small act—but it demonstrated the power of sustained attention. This boy gives 100% to everything he does.\n\nOn a different note, *Dr. Ritesh, a leader of the World Economic Forum, posted an interesting real-life scenario*:\n“My cousin bought a ₹2.8 lakh sofa last month. Six months later, she'd spent another ₹1.45 lakhs. Coffee table. Curtains. Lighting. Rug. Wall art. ‘Everything looked mismatched,’ she said. ‘I need to repaint the walls now.’” She wasn’t being indulgent—*she was trapped in a 255-year-old psychological pattern*.\n\nDr. Ritesh Malik highlights how the *Diderot Effect explains why one premium purchase often triggers a cascade of additional spending*. Your new sofa or car can make everything else feel outdated—leading to costly upgrades.\n\nIn India, *this is amplified by Instagram’s 362 million users, who are constantly inspired by curated homes, the rise of easy EMIs and “Buy Now, Pay Later” options*, and retail setups that tempt us to buy more. Durable, long-lasting furniture is being replaced every 5 years—driven not by need, but by attention-seeking upgrades.\n\nIn fact, *why do we do all this? To draw the attention of others?* Or to give our own eyes a fleeting feast? *If you have the money, it may still be acceptable. But doing this on EMI or debt is a dangerous trap*.\n\n*We bought our sofa exactly 25 years ago in Bangalore*. It has now moved with us to a fourth city. Somehow, it didn’t break or scratch! Of course, it looks old-fashioned—not jumbo-sized or fluffy. But instead of replacing it, we just painted it—and we’re still using it.\n\nMany homes are collapsing under the weight of debt. *People are taking extreme steps, including suicides*. If we earn 10 rupees, we should live with 9—not spend 20.\n\n*Prof. Chetan Singh Solanki from IIT Bombay is raising public consciousness about climate change*. He’s encouraging local energy generation and consumption in line with Gandhian principles and has built a people-powered movement called the Finite Earth Movement (FEM). Prof. Solanki resigned from IIT Bombay to dedicate himself full-time to this mission. *He has pledged not to return home until 2030, living fully in a solar bus*.\n\n*The attention economy may bring immediate happiness, but it rarely offers lasting comfort*.\n\nAre you also caught in this trap?\n\nRavi Saripalle",

Bees and other pollinating insects *improve the food production of 2 billion small farmers worldwide*, ensuring food security for the global population.” What effort have we truly made to preserve them?\n\nThe other day, *I witnessed an unethical way of removing a beehive*. We should feel ashamed. We are entering their zones—*thanks to rapid urbanization—and then asking them to leave their place*. It is like buying a house and renting it out, only to have the tenant threaten to occupy it.\n\nHabitat loss, pesticide use, climate change, and disease are contributing to an alarming decline in the numbers and diversity of pollinators. Pesticides intended to boost agricultural productivity are inadvertently poisoning these vital creatures, weakening their immune systems and disrupting their reproductive cycles.\n\nWe don’t need grand establishments, *but we do need policies that prioritize habitat conservation*. We can create landscapes and ecological corridors that allow bees to thrive.\n\n*Do we have urban bee towers the way we have parks for human recreation?* The time has arrived to establish one.\n\nRavi Saripalle",
